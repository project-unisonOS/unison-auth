# Security

The auth service is part of the UnisonOS control plane and handles authentication and token management.

For overall security guidance, including recommended auth and network configuration, see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you believe you have found a security issue in unison-auth, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub rather than filing a public issue.
